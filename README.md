# QiskitSolutions

I participated in QickStart-Qiskit Fall Fest 2022 with my team "Excalibur" as team captain. It included 6 sessions held in our campus to introduce us to quantum computing and qiskit followed by a challenge.
I have included the jupyter notebooks provided to us with the problem statement and they also contain the solutions submitted by our team.
